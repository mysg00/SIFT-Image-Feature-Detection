# SIFT Image Feature Detection
 
Implemented the SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm for image feature detection

Utilized Harris-Stevens corner detection, difference of Gaussian scale space for keypoint detection, Hessian constraint for keypoint localization, and histogram plotting for intensity gradient orientations at keypoints
